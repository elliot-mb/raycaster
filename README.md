# raycaster
naive approach to raycasting in javascript
## try this app out on [my website](https://elliotsemicolon.github.io/projects/raycaster/index.html "raycaster")
deployment currently set up to cast a high number of rays\
if you're getting performance issues, it will be because the raycount is too high and can be manually decresed in raycast.js
